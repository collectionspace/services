      Note that tests verifying this specific response may either fail, or
      return a non-fatal NESTED_ERROR, if the order of the list items below
      changes. (This response assumes that items are both returned in reverse
      chronological order by update timestamp (collectionspace_core:updatedAt),
      and that they are created in timestamp order by the order of tests in
      the control file.)
      
      If the list items order changes, you can: reorder the following
      list-items appropriately; remove those items entirely, relying solely
      on the <totalItems> value and not on the actual items returned; or
      rewrite the test and/or response using more sophisticated techniques.
