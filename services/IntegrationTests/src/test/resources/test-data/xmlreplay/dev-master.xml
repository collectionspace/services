<!-- Use this file to drive local testing.  

     To run this file, copy the checked-in file to your own local version of the correct name
     in the same location.  If it is named dev-master.xml, then XmlReplayDevTest will pick it up.
     If it is not there, XmlReplayDevTest will skip it, which is what we want for production, since 
     production runs XmlReplayMasterTest which calls xml-replay-master.xml
     
     	  cd trunk/services/IntegrationTests/src/test/resources/test-data/xmlreplay/
     	  cp dev-master-example.xml dev-master.xml

     IMPORTANT :: DO NOT CHECK IN YOUR LOCAL COPY, CALLED dev-master.xml
                  EITHER LEAVE IT AROUND AND IGNORE THE SVN UNVERSIONED FILE MESSAGE, 
                    OR DELETE IT IF IT BOTHERS YOU.
     
     Then, to run this file, you can execute the following: 
     
          cd trunk/services/IntegrationTests
          mvn test -Dtest=XmlReplayDevTest

     Maven surefire will kick off XmlReplayDevTest.
     
                  
     This file can be used to point at a controlFile 
		  and a testGroup, so you can test just one thing at a time, or a limited suite.
     
     You can find other tests to run in two places:
       The tests that get run on nightly: 
     	 xml-replay-master.xml
       The set of possible tests, including ones that don't work:
         dev-all.xml
