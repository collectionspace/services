Files formerly located in this directory are no longer needed
-------------------------------------------------------------

In CollectionSpace versions 4.0 and higher, changes were introduced
which streamline and simplify the process through which you configure
fields in CollectionSpace's main record types.

In most cases now, you will typically change the behavior of existing fields,
or create extension schemas to add new fields specific to your museum and/or
community of practice, merely by editing simpler XML-based configuration
files within CollectionSpace's Application layer.

Services layer files that were formerly located in this directory and
other, similar directories - which you previously needed to manually
create or edit - are now generated automatically from your configuration
in the Application layer.
