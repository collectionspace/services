The file authorization.sql is basically generated by the gen_ddl ant target, except for the Spring
Security table definitions. However, you must modify the result of that to make the

  DROP TABLE

statements be

  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table CASCADE

This ensures that first time setup does not fail, and that later invocations
can deal with dependencies.

You must also make the

  DROP SEQUENCE

statements be

  DROP SEQUENCE IF EXISTS

for similar reasons.

You must also remove (comment out) the statement (which is superfluous with the CASCADE above):

  alter table permissions_actions drop constraint FK85F82042E2DC84FD;

When using the account_tenants table on insert, you have to specify "nextval('hibernate_sequence')"
as the value for the HJID column.

Note that because of the way gen_ddl does its work per-sub-project, there is a single shared
sequence for both this and the authorization.sql script. This should be okay, even if it does
create gaps in what would be a nice sequence for each table.
